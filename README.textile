h1. clj-unit

@clj-unit@ is a simple unit testing library for Clojure. The goal of @clj-unit@ is to provide a non-magical, developer-friendly unit testing API along with a wide variety of assertion helpers.

h2. Features

 * Extremely small core implementation with a simple interface.
 * Pluggable reporters, with a built-in console reporter that uses "clj-backtrace":http://github.com/mmcgrana/clj-backtrace to provide trimmed, cleaned, and colorized backtraces on unit test errors.
 * Stateless facade for reporters, eliminating the need for them to maintain their own global state.
 * Many built in assertions.
 * New assertions can be implemented as stand-alone functions; they don't need to be methods or macros.

h2. Available Assertions

 * @assert-that@
 * @assert-not@
 * @assert-nil@

h2. Example Usage

    (ns myapp.utils-test
      (:use clj-unit.core))
    
    (deftest "re-match?"
      (assert-that (re-match? #"o"   "foo"))
      (assert-not  (re-match? #"bar" "foo")))
    
    (deftest "url-escape, url-unescape: round-trip as expected"
      (let [given "foo123!@#$%^(){}[]?/"]
        (assert= given (url-unescape (url-escape given)))))
    
    (deftest "check-keys: throws on unrecognized keys"
      (assert-throws #"unrecognized keys"
        (check-keys {:foo "bar" :fiz "bat"} [:foo :bar])))
    
    (run-tests 'myapp.utils-test)

Also, @clj-unit@ is used by the "Weld":http://github.com/mmcgrana and "Ring":http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring projects, both of which have substantial test suites: these would good places to look for production usage examples.
